## The Best PHP IDE

It's hard to argue the importance of a good **IDE** when it comes to programming. A good choice can greatly enhance the productivity of a programmer. It's worthwhile to remember though that the choice of an IDE is quite subjective and that there's no such thing as the right choice. Plus, every one of these tools has a learning curve.

Here, we take a look at the various development options for **PHP**. There's a lot for the community out there beyond gedit and Notepad.

### [jEdit](http://www.jedit.org)  
While not an IDE, jEdit 'the mature programmer's editor' can be a great choice, given the range of features it provides. It's **open-source**, and surprisingly **light-weight** compared to mainstream editors like Eclipse or Netbeans.  
    A number of **plugins** are available to enhance jEdit's functionality. It provides **syntax highlighting** for more than 200 languages, according to it's website. One can interact with the **shell** from inside the editor itself.

### [JetBrains PhpStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)  
PhpStorm is a popular choice among PHP programmers. The tool features smart **code completion** and **analysis**, which has won great reviews. It also packs in a handy **HTML/CSS/JavaScript editor**, and integrates well with the popular **revision control systems**. A major turn-off is that it doesn't come for **free**.

### [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/features/php/)  
A traditional favourite among programmers, NetBeans provides robust support for PHP as well. It supports the popular web frameworks **Zend** and **Symfony**, integrates with **SVN, CVS, git** and the PHP editor is dynamically integrated with it's friends **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**. It also offers a neat debugger for PHP, **Xdebug**.

### [phpDesigner](http://www.mpsoftware.dk/phpdesigner.php)  
An IDE that some would swear by, phpDesigner offers built-in support for **SQL, Perl, Python** and more. **Code completion, hinting, beautification, single-click comments, statement templates, php heredoc support, support for php 4** are some of its enticing features. Debugging becomes a whole lot easier with **Xdebug**. It's only available for **Windows** though and is not free, although it offers a trial version.

### [Eclipse PDT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP_Development_Tools)  
Eclipse fans can transition to PHP by using PDT, downloadable from inside Eclipse itself. Apart from all the cool generic features of **Eclipse**, it offers **Xdebug** and **Zend Debugger** support for debugging.

### [ActiveState Komodo](http://komodoide.com/)
Komodo is a mature **proprietary** product aimed at the PHP audience. It impresses with it's **HTTP inspector, JavaScript debugger and Regular Expression Toolkit**. It's possible to view not just PHP, but **running JavaScript and HTTP traffic** as well through Komodo.   
Komodo also comes in **free** (Komodo Edit) and **open** (OpenKomodo) flavors.

### [Aptana](http://www.aptana.com)  
Once past the **learning phase**, Aptana aptly rewards programmers with it's **pace**. It integrates very well with **Subversion**, **plugin installation** is smooth and **file search** is amazingly quick.
